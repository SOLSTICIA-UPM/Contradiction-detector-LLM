For example, the system should provide a password recovery mechanism that allows users to reset their passwords in case they forget their login credentials. On the other hand, the system must verify the user's login credentials before allowing the user to reset their password. These requirements complement each other and do not conflict. For example, the system must ensure that users can't lose their login credentials (Requirement 1), and if users do lose their login credentials then they should be able to recover their passwords (Requirement 2).\n",
